I am a senior [Electrical and Electronics Engineer (EEE)](https://ee.ku.edu.tr) at [Ko√ß University](https://eng.ku.edu.tr/en/)-studying on NLP, Deep Learning. I am doing tracks in both Artifical Intelligence and Digital Signal Processing in addition to my Major. Morphology has been a basis of linguistics and being able to understand the morphological structure of a language (like every 3 or 4 years old child) is on of the most sophisticated task in NLU. My research focuses on morphological analysis for Turkish language models and explore the unsupervised acquisition of it by using character-based transformers under [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr), advised by [Prof. Deniz Yuret](http://www.denizyuret.com/). 

I am also working on Computer Vision problems in object detion, object counting, and object tracking. Since training deep neural networks requires huge amounts of parameters, it is hard to embedd them in a mobile devices. I am interested in efficient object-detection algorithms by implementing and combining SoTA backbone model architectures to make them able to deploy in micro-chips in a mobile embedded platform.
