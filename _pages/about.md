I am a Computer Science MSc. student at [Koç University](https://www.ku.edu.tr/en/) and fellow at [KUIS AI Center](https://ai.ku.edu.tr). My research is in Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing, and Multimodal Learning. I've received bachelor degre from Electrical and Electronics Engineering (EEE) Department at Koç University.

Currenlty, I am working on Large-Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Language Models (VLMs). I am also interested in investigating methods for Multilingual Morphological Analysis.

On the other hand, I am working as a Deep Learning Engineer in a start-up at Palo Alto, California. I've worked on implementing efficient Neural Network architecutures for varying Computer Vision tasks that fits into mobile-embedded platforms. Now, I am working on deploying summarization, automatic speech recognition, and question answering models.

I enjoy going to gym, snowboarding, kite surfing, and reading. I was a member of Harley-Davidson Owners Group (HOG).
