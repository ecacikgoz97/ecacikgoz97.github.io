I am a senior [Electrical and Electronics Engineer (EEE)](https://ee.ku.edu.tr) at [Ko√ß University](https://eng.ku.edu.tr/en/). I am doing tracks in both Artifical Intelligence and Digital Signal Processing in addition to my Major. My research focus on morphological analysis for Turkish language models and explore the unsupervised acquisition of it by using character-based transformers as a NLP task by being a part of [KUIS AI](https://ai.ku.edu.tr). 

I am also working on Computer Vision problems suchs as object detion, person counting, person tracking and etc. Beside training a neural network with huge amounts of parameters, it is really hard to embedd them in a mobile embedded device.I am making and training efficient object-detection algorithms by implementing and combining SoTA backbone model architectures, and optimizing them to make them able to run in small CPU's and GPU's in a mobile embedded platform.  


I enjoy running, going to gym, reading, and following Euro-League Basketball. I also used be a member of [Harley-Davisdon Owners Group (HOG)](https://harley-davidson-istanbul-east.com/harley-owners-group), and I really like talking about motorcycles. If you want to have a chat, just reach me and let's have coffee together.
